The approach described in Alex's article also opens up another possibility, _storing_ your application's state (contained in the SQLite database) as plain text in a git repo. In fact, this is the approach I take with my [Homebrew packages bot](https://github.com/vincecima/homebrew-new-bot). Instead of using `sqlite3`, I use Simon Willisonâ€™s `sqlite_utils` package to do the [dump](https://github.com/vincecima/homebrew-new-bot/blob/b97ad2684e226193349acaef278b553d1717bfd3/src/homebrew_new_bot/__init__.py#L69-L74) and [restore](https://github.com/vincecima/homebrew-new-bot/blob/b97ad2684e226193349acaef278b553d1717bfd3/src/homebrew_new_bot/__init__.py#L79-L84) directly from the bot's Python code.
